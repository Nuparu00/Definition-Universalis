# Definition-Universalis
A tool designed to make adding provinces to Europa Universalis IV slightly easier.

## What it does?
The tool generates an entry in the definitions.csv file, generates a "template history file" and adds an entry to the prov_names_l_english.yml file. Keep in mind that to use this tool you have to have these files already in the mod folder. Also, the tool does not automatically increment the max_provinces limit in the default.map file. It is recommended to backup your mod folder before using this tool as it is quite untested and was made quite quickly.

## How to download
Download the DefinitionUniversalis.jar file from the build folder, or download the source and build the jar file yourself.

## How to install
1. Open the file by double click
2. The program will close and generate a file named config.ini in the same directory as is the .jar file
3. Open the config.ini file
4. Set the path of your mod (for example modPath=C:\Users\Nuparu\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\doggerland)
5. Open again the .jar file. If everything went allright, you should see a new window. 

## How to use
- The Home page shows only how many provinces are loaded and the path of your mod.
- The Add Province page allows you to add a new province
- The Provinces page contains a table of all loaded provinces

### How to add a province
1. Write the name of your province to the Name field
2. Select a color using the Select Color button, or generate a random free color using the Random Color button.
3. Click on the Add button.
